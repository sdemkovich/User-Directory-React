# User-Directory-React

## Description 
A ReactJS demo for an employee directory. The directory makes an Axios call to an API for a random 200 profiles and are displayed through react components and dynamically updated. It also demonstrates a search and sort functionality that allows the user to look for someone specifically.

To use the application, simply visit the deployed application. It's functionality is limited to the search and sort features and they are fairly self explanatory.


View, sort, and filter an API/Axios-generated employee list built using React components, state management, and user event handling.


## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
